Generalized Matrioshkas
=======================

Source: <http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=23&page=show_problem&problem=2052>

Problem that is solved either using two "synchronized" stacks
(that is, both are pushed and popped simultaneously)
or a stack of pairs of numbers.

The input of this problem is a bit tricky;
not only the input is EOF-terminated,
but the actual limits on the size are unknown.
Thus, the input vector must grow dynamically.

Concepts
========
- Stack
- Sentinel
- EOF-terminated input

Difficulty
==========
- Implementation: medium
- Conceptual: easy
