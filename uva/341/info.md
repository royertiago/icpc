Direct implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm,
with the requirement that the optimum path must be recovered.

Since the size limits of this problem is very small
(there is at most 10 nodes),
even slower implementations,
like using a vector instead of a priority queue,
will get accepted by the judge.
