I Can Guess the Data Structure!
===============================

Source: https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1340

This problem requires the simultaneous management of three data structures.
(Fortunately, the default priority queue of C++'s Standard Library
--- a "max queue" --- is exactly the required queue type.)

The hardest part is figuring that just simulating all three data structures is enough,
and then some contrived boolean logic.
